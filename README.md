Cyber Security Internship - Task 6
Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.
## Tools Used
mystrongpassword.com
## Steps Taken
1. Created passwords with varying complexity (weak, moderate, strong).
2. Tested each password on the tool.
3. Noted the strength results and feedback.
4. Researched common password attacks (brute force, dictionary, phishing, credential stuffing, rainbow table).
5. Identified best practices for password creation and management.
## Password Strength Results
Password Example	Strength Result	Notes
football123	Weak	Common dictionary word + numbers, easy to guess.
MyP@ssword!	Moderate	Has mix of characters but predictable pattern.
ThisPassPhra5sisLongAndStrong!	Strong	Long passphrase with numbers & special chars, very secure.
## Research: Common Password Attacks
1. Brute Force Attack
Automated guessing of all possible combinations until the correct password is found.
Longer & complex passwords make brute force highly time-consuming.
2. Dictionary Attack
Attackers use a precompiled list of common passwords (e.g., "123456", "football123").
Easily bypasses weak passwords found in leaked password databases.
3. Phishing Attack
Trick users into revealing their password via fake websites, emails, or messages.
Doesn’t rely on password complexity but on user awareness.
4. Credential Stuffing
Using stolen username-password pairs from one breach to log in elsewhere (since people reuse passwords).
5. Rainbow Table Attack
Uses precomputed hash values of passwords to crack encrypted password databases quickly.
Mitigated by salting passwords before hashing.
## Best Practices for Strong Passwords
Minimum 12–16 characters.
Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
Prefer passphrases (longer, more memorable combinations).
Never reuse the same password across multiple sites.
Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.
Store credentials safely in a password manager.
## Interview Questions Answered
1. What makes a password strong? Length, complexity, unpredictability.
2. What are common password attacks? Brute force, dictionary, phishing, rainbow table, credential stuffing.
3. Why is password length important? Longer passwords exponentially increase time to crack.
4. What is a dictionary attack? Using common word lists to guess passwords.
5. What is multi-factor authentication? Adding another layer of verification beyond passwords.
6. How do password managers help? They generate and securely store strong passwords.
7. What are passphrases? Long sequences of words/numbers used as secure passwords.
8. What are common mistakes in password creation? Using personal info, short/reused passwords, common words.
